 * PersonSearchUtil.java
 *
 * A utility class that provides a method for performing a recursive binary search.
 * Specifically, it's designed to search for {@link OCCCPerson} objects within a list,

 *
 * Demonstrates:
 * - Implementation of a recursive binary search algorithm
 * - String comparison for searching (case-insensitive)
 * - Utility class design with static methods
