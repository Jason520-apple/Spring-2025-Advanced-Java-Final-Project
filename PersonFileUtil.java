 * PersonFileUtil.java
 *
 * A utility class providing static methods for serializing and deserializing
 * lists of {@link Person} objects to and from files. This class uses Java's
 * built-in object serialization mechanism.
 *
 * Demonstrates:
 * - Java Object Serialization for saving and loading collections of objects
 * - Proper use of try-with-resources for stream management
 * - Handling of IOExceptions and ClassNotFoundExceptions during file operations
